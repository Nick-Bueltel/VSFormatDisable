# VSFormatDisable

## What is it? 
VSFormatDisable is a VSCode extension to prevent auto-formatting from occurring in your files based on file extension. 

This is to prevent code bases being formatted in such a way that could cause errors for other members in your team who could be using an IDE or build that only accepts certain types of code formatting. 

## Devs
